# 🌟 About NovaOS
NovaOS is a x86 protected mode operating system made in C and x86 Assembly by ArTic/JhoPro. It has a lot of features, including a GUI and a shell! This project is being actively developed as a personal journey to dive deeper into the world of operating systems. As such, NovaOS is constantly evolving, with new features and improvements being added over time. It’s a work in progress, but every update pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in this ambitious endeavor.
